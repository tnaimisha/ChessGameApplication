# ChessGameApplication

This is the first Java application I coded while learning java. It is one of my favourite personal projects.
I used SWING for designing the UI part. SWING follows mvc architecture(model and controller parts almost integrated).

Please find below the package and it's details:

Gui - the front end part of the code(chess board, tool bar for new, undo, save, restart options)

pieces - Functionality for various pieces in the game

management - Core of the application. DragAndDrop, undo,redo functionalities, validating piece movement, check and checkmate detection etc.

Board - backend datastructure for updating the movements.
